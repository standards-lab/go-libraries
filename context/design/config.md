# Configuration

How the libraries load and shape configuration. The `config` package holds the machinery; the code and
its `doc.go` are authoritative for the package surface.

## A loader in the base library, not a per-app convention

The baseline left configuration as a per-package *convention* — each capability shipped a
`Config`/`Env`/`Merge`/`Finalize` set, but there was no shared interface and no loader, so every consumer
hand-wrote the same file-layering `Load` (base file, environment overlay, secrets, then finalize). The
`config` package makes that loader a real base primitive: a single generic `Load` that every consumer
calls, parameterized by the filenames and the environment-selector variable rather than reimplemented.
The capabilities keep owning their own config types and merge/finalize behavior; what moves into the base
is only the orchestration they all shared.

## The contract

A configuration is a type `T` whose pointer implements the `config.Config[T]` constraint: `Merge(*T)` and
`Finalize() error`. Expressing the contract as a generic constraint keeps the methods concretely typed —
a capability writes `Merge(*Config)` and `Finalize() error` against its own type, with no `any` and no
type assertions — while letting `Load` drive any conforming type.

- **Merge** overlays a source's set fields onto the receiver: a non-zero source field wins, a zero one is
  left alone, and nested sub-configs delegate to their own merge. It is written field by field, without
  reflection. Because a set field always wins over an unset receiver, merging a fully-populated layer onto
  a zero value reproduces that layer — so `Load` treats the base file the same as every overlay rather
  than special-casing it.
- **Finalize** runs once, after every file has been merged, in a fixed order: apply defaults, read
  environment-variable overrides, then validate. Deferring validation to the end lets a required value
  arrive from any layer or from the environment. A malformed environment value fails Finalize — a bad
  input stops startup rather than being silently discarded.

## Layered load

`Load` reads up to four files from a directory, in precedence order, merging each that exists:

1. base file — `config.json`
2. environment overlay — `config.<env>.json`
3. secrets file — `secrets.json`
4. secrets overlay — `secrets.<env>.json`

then calls `Finalize` once. The active environment is the value of the configured selector variable; when
it is empty, both overlays are skipped. A single overlay pattern produces both overlay names from the base
and secrets stems, so the two files layer consistently. Every file is optional — a missing file is
skipped, and a directory with none yields a configuration carrying only what `Finalize` supplies; any
other read error, or malformed JSON, stops the load. Later files win over earlier ones, and the
environment overrides `Finalize` reads win over every file.

## Environment-variable names

Environment overrides are structured, not scattered `os.Getenv` calls. A capability pairs its config with
an `Env` struct whose fields hold the variable names its `Finalize` reads, and composes those names with
`config.EnvName(prefix, parts...)` — which upper-cases, drops empty segments, and joins with underscores.
Passing the names in through an `Env` value keeps the capability free of any one application's prefix, and
the struct is uniformly named `Env` across capabilities.

## Configuration is ephemeral

A configuration exists to initialize subsystems, not to be retained. A composition root loads it,
constructs subsystems from the values it carries, and discards it; runtime code holds the values it needs,
not the configuration. This keeps the point at which a setting is read fixed at startup, and lets a
subsystem be constructed in a test from plain values without assembling a whole configuration graph.
